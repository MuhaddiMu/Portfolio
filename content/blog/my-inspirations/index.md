Making my Inspiration list public to let others know what inspires me every day to keep moving and learning. Following peoples are not just inspirations but virtual mentors and motivators. I learn from their stories and failures every single day.

I always take inspiration from Evan's work. He is the software developer and the creator of Vue.js. Evan once applied for the job at Facebook. He got rejected in whiteboard programming test and now he is the creator of a most starred frontend framework. Thanks to Facebook.

[**Nathan Wu**](https://twitter.com/nathanwu21)<br/>
Nathan is not very much active in the community but his books really helped me to get a better understanding of Laravel and Vue. His writing style is very friendly and concise that anyone can easily understand the concepts. Read my review about Nathan book at here, here and here.
